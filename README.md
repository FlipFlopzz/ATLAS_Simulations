# ATLAS_Simulations
For the ATLAS Application 2023 Question:

How many points do you think the highest scorer in the applicant pool will get? Please be specific about any calculations and assumptions you make in producing this answer. (max. 500 characters)

Prompt:

Splitting the Pot
You’re going to play the following game with four other randomly selected Atlas applicants.

Each of you will submit a number below. I will then take the sum of the five numbers submitted, and subtract that sum from 50. 

Then, I’ll multiply the resulting number by your submission to get the number of points you are rewarded. Your goal is to maximize the number of points that you get.

For example, say the players are you, Alice, Bob, Clara, and Darius. The five of you submit numbers as follows:

You: 2
Alice: 1
Bob: 1
Clara: 1
Darius: 0

I will take the sum (2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 0 = 5), subtract it from 50 (50 - 5 = 45), and take that 45 and multiply it by each of your numbers to get your score. As a result, you would each end up with the following scores:

You: 90
Alice: 45
Bob: 45
Clara: 45
Darius: 0

Your goal is to maximize your own score, regardless of what scores the others end up with.
